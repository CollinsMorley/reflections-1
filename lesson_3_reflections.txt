When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would want to use a remote repository when you are working on a big project that involves other users. If you are doing a project
	by yourself, then I would keep it all on my local machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It's better to pull changes manually cause you always want to know what's on your machine and what's on GitHub. If Git stayed up to date
with GitHub, then some change maybe made that the user doesn't know about which can lead to bad things.
